## 📦 Project Overview
- This application performs the following operations:
- Accepts a text input and a desired accent (e.g., British, Indian, Australian).
- Validates and maps the accent to a corresponding TLD (e.g., .co.uk for British).
- Converts the text to speech using gTTS with the chosen accent.
- Saves the original text input to a file for logging (userinput.txt).
- Stores the generated MP3 audio file with a timestamped name.
- Encodes the MP3 file into a base64 string for easy usage in web or other systems.
- Returns the base64 audio string to the client for playback or transmission.
- Handles errors gracefully with custom exceptions (TTSException) and logging.
